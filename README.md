As the volume of data, digital transformation, and the pace of technological change accelerate, the ability of organizations and professionals to keep up and capitalize on the opportunity is becoming more challenging. AI provides an opportunity to help professionals close the gap and harness the full potential of data by creating new tools to improve their work and outcomes.

Designed to introduce clients and practitioners to a variety of AI capabilities within our Watson platform, this Proof of Technology (PoT) workshop is a full day event comprised of presentations and hands-on labs. The labs will introduce you to Natural Language Processing on unstructured data using Watson Discovery, creating a Watson-powered chatbot as well as building a cloud-native application using Watson APIs. We will also introduce the Watson Open Scale offering that delivers exciting features such as machine learning fairness evaluation, explainability and bias detection. 

1. [Lab1](Lab1) - The first lab illustrates a step-wise approach to performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on unstructured textual data using the cloud-native insights engine known as Watson Discovery. The use case entails the discovery of hidden insights from severe weather events in the United States over the past five years.

2. [Lab2](Lab2) - The second lab describes how to create a Watson-powered chatbot solution that concentrates on the context of each question and leverages machine learning approaches to train the virtual agent on a specific domain. Upon completion of this lab, students will be able to pair Watson Assistant with Watson Discovery in order to create a chatbot that can answer questions about severe weather events in the United States.

3. [Lab3](Lab3) - The third lab teaches students how to create a cloud-based application that will perform natural language processing of unstructured data - the corpus of domain knowledge as well as user-provided questions - and use multiple Watson APIs in a web-based architecture (HTML, CSS, NodeJS) in order to provide a user-interactive cognitive experience.

4. [Lab4](Lab4) - In this lab, we will look at how to detect and explain bias from within a classification model using easy to understand visualizations and automatically create new models that are free from bias.  Our particular exercise is focused on determining credit risk for individuals based on a variety of features and to validate whether there is bias detected across age groups and gender.

5. [Lab5](Lab5) - The final lab provides hands-on experience in using Watson Knowledge Studio to build a domain-specific machine learning model that is able to identify entities and relationships unique to an industry or profession. Models can be built without needing to write code and deployed to Watson Discovery Service or Watson Explorer.
