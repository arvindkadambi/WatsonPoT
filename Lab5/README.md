# Lab 5 - Watson Knowledge Studio 

## Description:

This lab guide is intended to provide you with hands-on experience in using Watson Knowledge Studio to build a machine learning annotator.  Knowledge Studio allows you to train domain-specific machine learning models that identify entities and relationships unique to an industry or profession. Models can be built without needing to write code and deployed to Watson Discovery Service or Watson Explorer.
