# Lab 4 - Watson OpenScale

In this lab of Watson OpenScale, we will be monitoring a credit risk modelâ€”a random forest that has been trained to determine whether or not someone is eligible for a loan based on a variety of different features, such as credit history, age, and gender. Upon completion of this lab, students will be able to monitor a model for bias and explainability within the OpenScale GUI.

This use case presented is the assesment of individuals applying for credit from a bank seeking to safely expand access to financial resources. The model and run time management tools allow easy access to both group and individual fairness metrics.
